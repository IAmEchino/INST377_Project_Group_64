      <p>Yes, this is. That’s the name of the page, in fact.</p>
      <p>Is This Real was created for the purpose of stopping scammers in their tracks by giving regular people the tools they need to check for fraud. <br> We have consolidated several industry-standard tools into one unified website which we hope will maximize convenience and ease of use for our users.</p>
